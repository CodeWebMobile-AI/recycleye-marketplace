*   **Frontend:** React 18+ with TypeScript
*   **Database:** MySQL
*   **Cache/Queue:** Redis
*   **Real-time:** Laravel Echo Server (local)

## 5. Architecture Overview

(This section can be elaborated upon if a more detailed architecture diagram or description is available.)

The application follows a typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.  The frontend, built with React and TypeScript, consumes data from the backend API. The backend, built with Laravel, handles user authentication, data validation, business logic, and interacts with the database (MySQL) and external APIs (image recognition, geolocation, payment gateway, SMS notifications). Redis is used for caching and queue management to improve performance. Laravel Echo Server provides real-time capabilities.

## 6. Prerequisites

*   **npm:**  Latest stable version (comes with Node.js)
*   **MySQL:**  Running instance of MySQL server
*   **Redis:**  Running instance of Redis server
*   **Laravel CLI:** Installed globally (`composer global require laravel/installer`)
*   **Docker** (optional): For containerized development and deployment

    ```

3.  Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4.  Configure your API endpoint in the `.env` file.  Example:
    ```env
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
    ```

5.  Start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## 8. Environment Setup

Configure the following environment variables. These are typically set in your `.env` files (backend and frontend).

## 9. Development Workflow

1.  **Branching:** Use a feature branching model. Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
2.  **Coding:** Follow coding standards for both Laravel and React.  Linting and code formatting tools are recommended.
3.  **Committing:**  Write clear and concise commit messages.
4.  **Pull Requests:** Submit pull requests for code review before merging into the main branch.
5.  **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for both backend and frontend components.

## 10. Testing
